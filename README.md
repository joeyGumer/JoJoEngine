HOW TO USE IT
----------------------------

Geometry Loading
----------------------------
Process to load any geometry:

1- Drop the fbx file into the engine window.
2- Automatically the model will be loaded with its texture.
3- You can modify its texture dragging another png file into the window.
4- In the Window->Console, you can check all the loading process

At this moment the 3D drawing process works without shaders, through vertices and indices.

Editor movement

- Move the camera with AWSD.
- Zoom in/out with the mouse wheel.
