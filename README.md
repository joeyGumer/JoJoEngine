HOW TO USE IT
----------------------------

Geometry Loading
----------------------------
Process to load any geometry:
- Drop the fbx file into the engine window.
- Automatically the model will be loaded with its texture.
- You can modify its texture dragging another png file into the window.
- In the Window->Console, you can check all the loading process

At this moment the 3D drawing process works without shaders, through vertices and indices.

Editor movement
------------------------------
- Move the camera with AWSD.
- Zoom in/out with the mouse wheel.
